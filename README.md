# Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback

## Objective

This project aims to analyze customer feedback and reviews to gain insights into customer sentiment, helping businesses enhance their products, services, and overall customer experience.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- SQL

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model to classify customer feedback as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It provides actionable insights that help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve their offerings.

### Key Components

- **Data Collection and Preparation**  
  Customer feedback was gathered from various sources such as surveys, social media, and product reviews. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

- **Model Development**  
  The sentiment analysis model was developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization, to preprocess the text data. Machine learning algorithms were used to classify customer sentiments.

- **Performance Optimization**  
  The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Further optimization techniques were applied to improve model performance.

### Model Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization
   - Stop-word removal
   - Lemmatization
   - Vectorization (TF-IDF/Count Vectorizer)

2. **Model Training:**
   - Implemented machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   
3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-customer-feedback.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment and run the model:
   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

### Results

The model classifies customer feedback into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, offering valuable insights that can drive improvements in customer experience.

## Key Skills Acquired

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques** for Sentiment Analysis
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stop-word Removal
- **Machine Learning Model Development** for classification tasks
- **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Future Enhancements

- Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or BERT) for improved performance.
- Integrate real-time sentiment analysis for live customer feedback.
- Expand the dataset by incorporating more diverse sources of customer reviews.
